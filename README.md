## Features

- **Task Creation:** Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list by typing in the task description and clicking the "Add" button. This streamlines the process of recording planned activities.

- **Completion Tracking:** Once a task is completed, users can mark it as done by clicking on the checkbox next to the task. This visually indicates the progress and helps users keep track of their accomplishments.

- **Task Deletion:** Users have the option to remove completed tasks from the list. This declutters the interface and keeps the focus on the tasks that still need attention.
